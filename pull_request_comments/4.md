Current issues that need to be fixed:

1. **Sidebar Issues:**
   - Sidebar can't scroll to see notes
   - Filter button doesn't work
   - Need to add video pause button between 5s rewind and fast forward buttons
   - Move video control buttons lower, closer to note-taking section for better UX

2. **Dashboard Issues:**
   - Can't edit notes in dashboard
   - Tag colors aren't visible
   - Export button in settings still doesn't work

3. **UX Improvements:**
   - Video controls should be repositioned closer to note-taking area to reduce cursor movement
   - Need proper scrolling in sidebar notes section
   - Tag colors need to be visible and functional

Please prioritize these fixes as they affect core functionality. The video pause button should be positioned between rewind and fast forward for intuitive control flow.
